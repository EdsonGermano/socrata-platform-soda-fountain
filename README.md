**soda-fountain** is Socrata's HTTP REST server for serving Socrata Open Data API (SODA) version 2 API requests.  It talks to two other REST microservices, the data-coordinator, and the query-coordinator, to manage both CRUD operations on datasets as well as queries against datasets.

## Projects

* soda-fountain-lib -- most of the code lives here, including routes, request handling, etc.
